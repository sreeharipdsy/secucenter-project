            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require 
            commercial websites and online services to post a privacy 
            policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California 
            to require a person or company in the United States (and 
            conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting 
            personally identifiable information from California 
            consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its 
            website stating exactly the information being collected 
            and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and 
            to comply with this policy.
        </p>
